This lab introduces the machine learning workflow and provides hands-on experience with using deep neural networks (DNN) to solve a challenging real-world image classification problem.  We will work through all phases of the deep learning workflow including data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and methods to improve training accuracy including data augmentation and network optimization. You will also see the benefits of GPU acceleration in the model training process.  On completion of this lab you will have the knowledge to train a DNN on your own image classification dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deep learning is the use of many hidden layers in an artificial neural network to train a model to learn and understand the data without an inherent understanding of what the data is.  Deep learning is being used by many different disciplines to allow computers to learn from vast amounts of data.  Recent advances in computer vision, object detection and natural language processing can be attributed to the adoption of Deep Learning techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key to the success of deep learning is the convolutional neural network (CNN).  In a traditional neural network, a artificial neurons in a layer are fully connected to the previous and next layer.  In a [convolutional neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network), overlapping regions of the network are associated instead of the entire layer.  Biologically inspired, a convolutional network acts as filters to process pieces of data.  The result is that these networks can act as feature extractors at both coarse and fine scales eliminating the need to design custom feature extractors as was done previously in traditional computer vision.  CNNs can be trained to recognize structure in large sets of data including images, voice, and text.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow of deep learning is a multi-phase, iterative process.  \n",
    "    1.  First, data must be gathered and pre-processed.  While the Internet and big data have provide access to massive quantities of data, the data often needs to be verified, labeled, and pre-processed for consistency.  \n",
    "    2.  Second, the data is used to train a network.  Pre-existing networks can be used or new ones can be developed.  Both the network and the training process have many variables that can be modified and tuned which affect the training rate and accuracy.\n",
    "    3.  Third, models need to be tested to verify they are working as expected.  Often at this point one iteriates over the steps to improve the results.  This includes Reprocessing data, modifying networks, modifying parameters of the networks or solvers, and retesting until the desired results are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial today, you will work through all phases of the deep learning workflow to solve a classic machine learning problem, image classification.  We will be using a multi-layer convolutional neural network to train our model to recognize several types of images from the Microsoft Coco database. The Coco database contains hundreds of thousands of images with millions of various objects contained within them.  Coco is a classic data set for various computer vision tasks.  We will learn to classify an image between 11 different classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify the process of the deep learning workflow, we will be using NVIDIA's [DIGITS](https://developer.nvidia.com/digits).  DIGITS is a Deep Learning GPU Training System that helps users develop and test convolutional neural networks. DIGITS supports multiple frameworks, data formats, and training goals including image classification and object detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, DIGITS also includes a workload manager.  The workload manager allows the user to launch multiple jobs of different types and it coordinates access to the local resources.  If multiple GPUs are present, jobs can run simultaneously.  If more jobs are created than the resources available, the jobs will be queued until resources become free.  The DIGITS dashboard allows the user to monitor all of the active jobs and their current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the [Caffe](http://caffe.berkelyvision.org) framework.  Caffe was created by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BLVC).  Caffe is a flexible and extensible framework that provides researchers the means to train networks without writing all of the code necessary to do so.  Model training can be parallelized across multiple GPUs to accelerate learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "To decrease training time, simplify the provisioning process as well as reduce costs, we will be using the Azure N Series virtual machines; which provide hardware access to 1-4 K-80 GPUs depending on configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will cover the typical tasks of the deep learning workflow.  First, we will review the creation of the Coco data set for classification.  Second, we will train a model to classify the Coco images.  Third, we will test the trained model against other test data and analyze the results.  After this, we will augment the data and modify the standard network to try and improve our image classification accuracy."
